                <h2>Illustrator, 2023</h2>
                <p>Individual project done on Adobe Illustrator.
                    I strive to capture the feeling of a tropical summer by using warm earthy tones. I like to play around with my line work and colors in my work. The purpose of this project was to reflect my artistic skills and to show the type of illustration I am interested in/capable of. I also used this as an opportunity to show my experience in Adobe Illustrator.

                    This was inspired by a photo I took while on a picnic. I experimented with balancing simplicity as well as complexity to capture the details of the image.

                <h2>Illustrator, 2022</h2>
                <p>This icon is inspired by the graphic designer, Jessica Hische. Done on Adobe Illustrator. I strive to capture her use of bright colors and child like illustrations within the project. Jessica Hische is also well known for her intricate lettering which I represent on the side of the blocks which are her initials. The purpose of this project was to embody a female designer in an icon. </p>

                <h2>Acrylic, 2022</h2>
                <p>This is an acrylic painting inspired by the art of dancing. It represents the grace and strength that a dancer must balance and the self-discipline within the art itself. In the painting, I experimented with different values and limiting my color palette. This piece was made for my AP portfolio which was about the beauty of the women and nature.</p>
